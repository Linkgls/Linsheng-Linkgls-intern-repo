# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## Why is Ergonomic Setup Important?

Working on a laptop without proper ergonomic adjustments can lead to:

- **Poor Posture:**  
  Slouching or hunching over the laptop increases the risk of back, neck, and shoulder pain.
- **Neck Strain:**  
  Looking down at a laptop screen for prolonged periods stresses the neck muscles.
- **Wrist Discomfort:**  
  Extended use of a laptop keyboard can lead to repetitive strain injuries in the wrists and hands.
- **Eye Strain:**  
  Incorrect monitor positioning can cause visual fatigue and headaches.

## Ergonomic Equipment & Adjustments

### Equipment to Improve Posture

- **Laptop Stand:**  
  Raises the laptop screen to eye level, reducing neck strain.
- **External Keyboard and Mouse:**  
  Allow for a more natural hand and wrist position.
- **Ergonomic Chair:**  
  Provides proper lumbar support and encourages a good sitting posture.
- **Adjustable Desk:**  
  Enables you to switch between sitting and standing, reducing the risk of prolonged sedentary behavior.

### Recommended Adjustments for a Healthier Workspace

- **Monitor Height:**  
  The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level.
- **Chair Position:**  
  Your feet should be flat on the floor (or on a footrest), and your knees should be at a 90-degree angle.
- **Desk Setup:**  
  Ensure that your work surface is at a comfortable height to prevent shoulder strain and allow your arms to rest at a natural angle.
- **Daily Habits:**
  - Take regular movement breaks (e.g., every 30-60 minutes).
  - Perform posture checks throughout the day.
  - Use eye strain reduction techniques like the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds).

## Reflection

### Equipment Changes to Improve My Workspace

- **New Equipment:**  
  I have recently added a **laptop stand** to raise my screen, and I now use an **external keyboard and mouse** to promote a more natural wrist and arm position.
- **Workspace Adjustments:**  
  I’ve adjusted my chair height so that my feet rest flat on the floor and my knees form a 90-degree angle.

### Behavioral Changes to Improve Posture and Reduce Strain

- **Posture Awareness:**  
  I make a conscious effort to sit upright and maintain a good posture.
- **Regular Breaks:**  
  I have started using Focus Bear’s built-in movement break reminders to take short breaks every 30 minutes.
- **Eye Rest Techniques:**  
  I apply the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain, ensuring I look away from the screen periodically.

### Reminders to Maintain Good Posture

- **Digital Reminders:**  
  I use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks and posture checks throughout the day. This helps me stay mindful of my posture and avoid sitting for too long without moving.
- **Visual Cues:**  
  I’ve placed a small sticky note on my monitor as a reminder to check my posture regularly.
