# AI Usage Guidelines at Focus Bear

## Research & Learn

### Common AI Tools for Our Roles

- **Code Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT):**  
  Help with code suggestions, documentation, and debugging.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization Tools:**  
  Tools like AI-powered data insights platforms that can help in interpreting complex datasets.
- **Content Generation Tools:**  
  Assist in writing documentation, emails, or generating ideas for blog posts and technical articles.
- **Design and Prototyping:**  
  Tools that use AI to generate design mockups or enhance UX (e.g., Figma’s AI plugins).

### Benefits and Risks of Using AI in a Professional Setting

- **Benefits:**
  - **Increased Productivity:** AI tools can speed up routine tasks, such as code generation and data analysis.
  - **Enhanced Creativity:** They offer new ideas and perspectives that can spark innovation.
  - **Error Reduction:** AI can help catch mistakes, provide suggestions, and assist in debugging.
- **Risks:**
  - **Data Privacy Concerns:** Entering sensitive or confidential data into AI systems can lead to data leaks.
  - **Over-Reliance:** Excessive dependence on AI might reduce critical thinking and independent problem-solving skills.
  - **Accuracy and Bias:** AI-generated content may contain errors or biased information if not fact-checked.

### Information to Avoid Entering into AI Tools

- **Confidential or Proprietary Data:**  
  Avoid sharing customer data, internal project details, or trade secrets.
- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**  
  Do not input sensitive personal data such as Social Security Numbers, full names with addresses, or financial details.
- **Sensitive Business Strategies:**  
  Keep internal strategies and unreleased product details out of AI tools.

### Fact-Checking and Validating AI-Generated Content

- **Cross-Reference with Trusted Sources:**  
  Always compare AI outputs with official documentation, reputable websites, or internal guidelines.
- **Manual Review:**  
  Rely on your own expertise to critically evaluate AI suggestions and verify with team members when necessary.
- **Iterative Improvement:**  
  Use AI-generated content as a draft, then refine and edit it to ensure it meets the required standards.

## Reflection

### When to Use AI for Assistance vs. Relying on Your Own Skills

- **Use AI for Assistance When:**
  - Handling repetitive or time-consuming tasks such as boilerplate code generation.
  - Seeking inspiration or alternative solutions to common problems.
  - Quickly gathering initial research or troubleshooting ideas.
- **Rely on Your Own Skills When:**
  - Working with sensitive or confidential data.
  - Making critical decisions that impact system architecture or business strategy.
  - Ensuring final outputs are accurate, particularly in areas where domain expertise is essential.

### Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI While Still Benefiting from It

- **Complement, Don’t Replace:**  
  Use AI as a tool to augment your capabilities rather than a substitute for your own analysis.
- **Regular Reviews:**  
  Periodically review AI-generated suggestions and cross-check them with manual research.
- **Continuous Learning:**  
  Stay updated with industry best practices and ensure that you are not solely relying on AI outputs but are also honing your skills.

### Steps to Ensure Data Privacy When Using AI Tools

- **Limit Data Sharing:**  
  Only provide non-sensitive, anonymized data when interacting with AI tools.
- **Understand the Tool’s Privacy Policy:**  
  Familiarize yourself with how the AI tool stores and processes your data.
- **Use Internal Tools Where Possible:**  
  When dealing with confidential information, use internal or on-premise AI solutions that offer better data control.
- **Educate Yourself:**  
  Keep up with the latest data security practices and ensure you follow company policies regarding data privacy.

### Practical Task: Improving a Task with AI

- **Task Identification:**  
  I used an AI code assistant to generate initial boilerplate for a new feature.
- **Review Process:**  
  After generating the code, I manually reviewed it, compared it with our coding guidelines, and made necessary adjustments.
- **Best Practice Established:**  
  I will always treat AI-generated outputs as drafts. I plan to implement a final review step to verify accuracy and ensure that no confidential data is inadvertently shared.
