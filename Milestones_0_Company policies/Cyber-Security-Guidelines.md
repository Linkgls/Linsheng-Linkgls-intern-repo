# Cyber Security Guidelines for Focus Bear

## Why is Cyber Security Important?

Cyber security breaches can lead to data leaks, financial losses, and damage to company reputation. Everyone at Focus Bear has a role in protecting sensitive information by following best practices and staying vigilant against threats.

## Common Cyber Security Threats in a Remote Work Environment

- **Phishing Attacks:**  
  Emails or messages that appear to be from trusted sources but are designed to steal your credentials or infect your device.

- **Malware and Ransomware:**  
  Malicious software that can compromise your device and data, sometimes encrypting files until a ransom is paid.

- **Unsecured Networks:**  
  Using public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks can expose your data to interception.

- **Social Engineering:**  
  Techniques that trick individuals into divulging confidential information through manipulation.

- **Insider Threats:**  
  Employees or contractors who accidentally or intentionally expose company data.

## Best Practices for Keeping Devices and Accounts Secure

- **Lock Your Computer:**  
  Always lock your computer when away from your desk. This prevents unauthorized access, especially in shared or public spaces.

- **Strong Passwords and Password Managers:**  
  Use complex passwords and store them securely with a password manager to avoid reuse and simplify management.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  
  Enable 2FA on all critical accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.

- **Regular Software Updates:**  
  Keep your operating system, apps, and antivirus software up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.

- **Be Wary of Suspicious Links:**  
  Always verify the sender and the URL before clicking on links or downloading attachments. Report any suspicious activity immediately.

## Reflection

### Current Security Measures and Areas for Improvement

- **Current Measures:**

  - I use strong, unique passwords for each account along with a password manager.
  - My computer and phone are set to auto-lock after a few minutes of inactivity.
  - I have enabled 2FA on all critical work accounts.

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - I can be more proactive with regular security audits of my devices.
  - I need to further educate myself on identifying phishing attempts.
  - I plan to review and update my password manager entries regularly.

### Making Secure Behavior a Habit

- **Consistent Practices:**
  - Setting up automatic lock screens ensures that my devices are secure even if I forget to lock them manually.
  - Using 2FA and a password manager reduces the risk of password-related breaches.
  - Regularly reviewing security guidelines and training sessions can help reinforce best practices.

### Steps to Ensure Passwords and Account Security

- Regularly update passwords and avoid reusing them across accounts.
- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
- Enable 2FA on every account that supports it.
- Monitor account activity and immediately report any suspicious behavior.

### Handling Suspected Security Breaches

If I suspect a security breach or observe suspicious activity, I will:

- Immediately change passwords and enable additional security measures if not already in place.
- Report the incident to the IT/security team at Focus Bear.
- Monitor my accounts for any unusual activity and follow up as necessary.

## New Cyber Security Habit

Starting this week, I will schedule a monthly review of my password manager and update any passwords that may be weak or outdated. I will also stay informed about the latest phishing tactics by subscribing to a cybersecurity newsletter.
