  The Unit Tests serve as a safety guard for the code. They will verify that each component behaves as expected. By checking each single unit and writing tests for them, all functions and modules will be designed to focus on single responsibility.
- **What issues did you find while testing?**
  Hard to achieve 100% coverage for large project. And the original design of the whole project will affect a lot to unit test part.
