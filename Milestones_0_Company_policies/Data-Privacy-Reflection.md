## Personal Reflection on Data Security

### Steps to Handle Data Securely in Daily Tasks

- **Strict Access Management:**  
  I will always ensure that I use secure, company-approved methods when
  accessing and sharing sensitive information.
- **Regular Updates and Training:**  
  Staying current with data security training and following internal guidelines
  will help me adhere to best practices.
- **Vigilance with Confidential Data:**  
  I will avoid discussing sensitive information in unsecured channels and ensure
  that I only access data necessary for my tasks.

### Storing, Sharing, and Disposing of Sensitive Information

- **Storing Data:**  
  I will store confidential information only in encrypted, secure
  company-approved systems.
- **Sharing Data:**  
  I will use secure file-sharing platforms, avoid email when possible for
  sensitive data, and ensure that only authorized recipients have access.
- **Disposing of Data:**  
  When data is no longer needed, I will follow company guidelines for secure
  deletion, such as using certified data wiping tools or processes that ensure
  complete removal.

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

- **Improper Access Controls:**  
  Allowing unrestricted access to confidential information can lead to data
  leaks. I will avoid this by verifying permissions and following the principle
  of least privilege.
- **Insecure Communication Channels:**  
  Using public or unsecured networks to share sensitive data can expose it to
  interception. I will only use secure, encrypted channels.
- **Neglecting Updates and Patches:**  
  Failing to update software can leave vulnerabilities open. I will ensure my
  devices and applications are up-to-date.
- **Accidental Data Exposure:**  
  Over-sharing in emails or chats can lead to unintended disclosures. I will
  double-check the recipient list and use encryption where necessary.

### New Habit to Improve Data Security

**Adopt a “Security Check” Routine:**  
Before sending, sharing, or storing any sensitive data, I will follow a
checklist to ensure that:

- The data is necessary and minimal.
- It is stored or shared using secure methods.
- Only authorized individuals can access it.

This habit will help make secure behavior a natural part of my workflow and
minimize the risk of accidental data breaches.
