# Using Native Modules and Bridging in React Native

## Why Would You Need to Use Native Modules in a React Native App?

- **Access to Platform-Specific Features:**  
  Some functionalities, such as accessing system settings, notifications, or background services, require native code. Native modules let you tap into these features without waiting for React Native to support them out-of-the-box.

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  For computationally heavy tasks, native code can offer better performance compared to JavaScript. Offloading these tasks to native modules helps maintain smooth performance.

- **Integration with Existing Native Libraries:**  
  Native modules allow you to integrate with third-party SDKs or libraries written in Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, or Java, thereby extending the capabilities of your app.

## How Does React Native Communicate with Native Code?

- **The Bridge:**  
  React Native uses an asynchronous bridge to communicate between JavaScript and native code. Data is serialized (often as JSON) and passed between the two environments.

- **Native Module API:**  
  Native modules are created by implementing platform-specific interfaces (e.g., `RCTBridgeModule` for iOS or `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` for Android). Once registered, these modules expose methods that can be called from JavaScript.

- **Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await:**  
  Communication often uses callbacks or promises. This ensures that the JavaScript side can handle responses or errors from native methods asynchronously.

## Challenges of Maintaining Native Bridges

- **Increased Complexity:**  
  Writing and maintaining code across two different languages (JavaScript and native languages like Swift or Kotlin) adds complexity to the project.

- **Performance Overhead:**  
  The bridge communication is asynchronous and involves serialization, which can introduce latency—especially for performance-critical tasks.

- **Debugging Difficulties:**  
  Errors might originate on either the JavaScript or the native side, making debugging more challenging. Debugging across the bridge requires tools and expertise in both environments.

- **Platform-Specific Code Maintenance:**  
  Maintaining separate implementations for iOS and Android can lead to discrepancies and increased maintenance overhead.

- **Upgrading Challenges:**  
  Changes in React Native’s bridge mechanism or updates in native APIs might require significant refactoring of custom native modules.
