1. React Developer Tools
   - This extension will inspect the React component hierarchies, which could help us debugging React applications efficiently.
2. Redux DevTools
   - Helps in debugging Redux state changes, tracking dispatched actions, and inspecting the overall state flow in applications that use Redux.
3. JSON Viewer
   - Easy to watch the structure of JSON data.
   - And compared to the other extension(JSON Formatter), I prefer this style to show JSON.
