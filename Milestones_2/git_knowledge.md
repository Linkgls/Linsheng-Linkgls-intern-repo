# Git Knowledge

- **Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**
  Yes, I have used Git before.
  For storage my own code or notes and for the courses in college.
- **Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**
  I choose to use Git Desktop for cloning and creating repositories and use Git in VS Code for push and pull.
  I like to use the UI to Create and Clone repositories, which is clear and easy to set the settings. And for push and pull, it is inconvenient to switch back and forth between windows after writing the code.
- **What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**
  Set the personal token.
