# Unit Test

## Reflection about Introduction to Unit Testing with Jest

- **Why is automated testing important in software development?**
  - This will prevent regressions, and help ensure that new changes won't break existing functionality.
  - The clear test will form a documentation for expected behaviors.
  - Although writing tests takes time upfront, it reduces debugging time and manual testing efforts in the long run.
- **What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?**
  - When I press a in the watch mode and run the default App test there seem an issue that jest cannot find the react-router-dom... And I still don't resolve that.
