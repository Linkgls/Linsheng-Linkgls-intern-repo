# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## How a Kanban Board Works

A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage their workflow by showing tasks as they move through different stages of completion. It typically consists of several columns, each representing a different stage of the work process. Tasks are represented as cards that move from one column to the next until they are complete.

### Common Columns on a Kanban Board

- **Backlog:**  
  This column contains tasks that are yet to be started. They are prioritized and ready to be picked up when capacity allows.

- **In Progress:**  
  Tasks that are currently being worked on are placed here. This column represents active work and is typically limited by a Work In Progress (WIP) limit to prevent overloading the team.

- **Blocked:**  
  Any task that cannot move forward due to dependencies, missing information, or technical issues is moved to the Blocked column. This helps in quickly identifying and addressing impediments.

- **Done:**  
  Completed tasks are moved to this column. It provides a visual representation of work finished and helps track progress over time.

### Task Movement & Responsibility

- **Task Flow:**  
  As work progresses, team members pick tasks from the Backlog, move them to In Progress, and finally shift them to Done once completed. If an issue arises, tasks can be moved to the Blocked column until the problem is resolved.

- **Responsibility:**  
  While all team members collaborate to update task statuses, the individual working on a task is primarily responsible for moving their task through the board. A Kanban facilitator (or Agile PM) may also help monitor the board to ensure tasks are updated correctly and WIP limits are respected.

### Benefits of Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)

- **Focus and Quality:**  
  Limiting WIP helps team members focus on completing tasks rather than multitasking, which can lead to higher quality work.

- **Reduced Context Switching:**  
  With fewer tasks in progress at any one time, developers can avoid constant context switching, improving efficiency.

- **Quick Identification of Bottlenecks:**  
  WIP limits make it easier to identify when tasks are piling up in a particular stage, indicating potential issues that need to be addressed.

- **Balanced Workload:**  
  Ensuring that team members are not overloaded leads to a more sustainable pace and prevents burnout.

## Reflection

### How Does Kanban Help Manage Priorities and Avoid Overload?

Kanban's visual nature and WIP limits provide a clear picture of the team's capacity and workload. By limiting the number of tasks in progress, it:

- **Prevents Overcommitment:**  
  Only a manageable number of tasks are allowed in progress at one time, reducing the risk of overload.
- **Improves Focus:**  
  Teams can concentrate on finishing current tasks before starting new ones, which helps maintain a steady and predictable flow of work.
- **Highlights Bottlenecks:**  
  A visual board immediately shows where tasks are accumulating, enabling prompt intervention to resolve issues and re-prioritize work as needed.

### How Can You Improve Your Workflow Using Kanban Principles?

One way to enhance task tracking and workflow in my role is by:

- **Regularly Updating the Board:**  
  Ensuring that tasks are updated in real time helps maintain transparency and clear communication.
- **Collaborative Reviews:**  
  Setting up regular check-ins (e.g., a daily standup) to review the Kanban board can identify blockers and opportunities for process improvements.
- **Refining WIP Limits:**  
  Adjusting the WIP limits based on team capacity and project demands can further optimize productivity. For example, if I notice a consistent bottleneck in the "In Progress" column, I can collaborate with the team to adjust the limits or reassign tasks.

By adopting these practices, I can improve task visibility, ensure timely completion, and foster better collaboration with team members.
