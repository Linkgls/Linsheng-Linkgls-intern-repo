# Research Best Debugging Techniques for React

## Debugging strategies

- **What are the most common debugging techniques?**

  - **Console logging:**
    Use the 'console.log()', 'console.error()', and some other console methods to trace the flow data and identify issues during runtime.
  - **React DevTools:**
    The React DevTools could inspect the component tree, state, props in real time. It has the plugins on web browser.
  - **React Profiler:**
    Utilize the React Profiler to analyze rendering performance, identify unnecessary renders, and spot performance bottlenecks.
  - **Breakpoint Debugging:**
    In VS Code, there are some breakpoints that could be set to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables at runtime.
  - **Linting & Type Checking:**
    Use ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript to catch errors and enforce best practices before runtime.

- **Tools Most Effective for React Debugging**
  I think the most effective tool is React DevTools. It provides a real-time, visual representation of your component tree, allowing you to inspect state, props, and hooks. Make it much easier to track down rendering issues and understand how your components update.

- **Debugging Large React Codebases**
  - **Incremental Isolation:**  
    When faced with a bug, isolate the issue by commenting out or refactoring parts of the code, then gradually reintroduce functionality to pinpoint the problem.
  - **Modularization:**
    Make the whole project modularize, and this will let the debug more easily. I can focus on which specific logic has problem, and only track one work flow.
  - **Automated Testing:**
    Use the ESLint and Typescript to identify the bug earlier in the development cycle.
