# Ai Tools

- **Which AI tools did you try?** I have tried the Copilot in VSCode and
  Chatgpt.
- **What worked well? What didnâ€™t?** They both worked well, when I let them to
  debug some pre-prepared bugs and to generate some easy snippets.
- **When do you think AI is most useful for coding?** I think AI is very helpful
  for debugging, they could provide a clear logic of some snippets. Therefore, I
  can easily find the most likely places for bugs.
